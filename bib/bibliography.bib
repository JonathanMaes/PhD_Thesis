abstract = {Abstract Emergent behaviors occur when simple interactions between a system's constituent elements produce properties that the individual elements do not exhibit in isolation. This article reports tunable emergent behaviors observed in domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under an applied rotating magnetic field. DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic ring arrays’ properties (e.g., non-linear behavior, “fading memory” to changes in field, fabrication repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in hardware. By way of example, simulations of ring arrays performing RC approaches 100\% success in classifying spoken digits for single speakers.},

    abstract = "{Artificial spin ice (ASI) are systems of coupled nanomagnets arranged on a 2D lattice. ASIs are promising computing substrates due to the rich variety of emergent behavior, accompanied by considerable control and flexibility. Computational models may exploit the small-scale dynamics of the individual elements, or large-scale emergent behavior of the resulting metamaterial. We investigate the computational capabilities of “pinwheel” ASI, whose emergent ferromagnetic patterns can be observed at different scales. Within a reservoir computing framework, we examine how key system parameters affect performance using well-established reservoir quality metrics. As reservoir output, we consider system state at different granularities, ranging from individual magnets to the collective state of multiple magnets. Our results show that pinwheel ASI exhibits excellent computing capacity, including evidence of fading memory. Interestingly, a wide range of output granularities
          result in good performance, offering new insights into the scalability and robustness of reservoirs based on self-organized collective behavior. The apparent flexibility in output granularity show that ASIs have computational properties at different abstraction levels, from the small-scale dynamics of simple elements, to the large-scale spatial patterns of the metamaterial.}",

I argue that attempting to force such novel approaches into the conventional Universal Turing computational framework will provide neither insights into theoretical questions of computation, nor more powerful computational machines. Instead, we should be investigating matter from the perspective of its natural computational capabilities. I also argue that we should investigate nonbiological substrates, since these are less complex in that they have not been tuned by evolution to have their particular properties. Only then we will understand both aspects of computation (logical and physical) required to understand the computation occurring in biological systems.}

We find that at temperatures T < Tc, the critical temperature, the new technique is faster than the standard technique, being ten times faster at T = 0.588 Tc. We expect that the new technique will be especially valuable in Monte Carlo simulation of the time evolution of binary alloy systems. The new algorithm is essentially a reorganization of the standard algorithm. It accounts for the a priori probability of changing spins before, rather than after, choosing the spin or spins to change.}

The exponent v is closely related to the fractal dimension and the information dimension, but its computation is considerably easier. Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.}

We look at the state of the art of DW applications and give our take on the their current status, technological feasibility and challenges.}

An ESN consists of a large, fixed, recurrent "reservoir" network, from which the desired
output is obtained by training suitable output connection weights. Determination of
optimal output weights becomes a linear, uniquely solvable task of MSE minimization.
This article reviews the basic ideas and describes an online adaptation scheme based
on the RLS algorithm known from adaptive linear systems. As an example, a 10-th order
NARMA system is adaptively identified. The known benefits of the RLS algorithms carry
over from linear systems to nonlinear ones; specifically, the convergence rate and
misadjustment can be determined at design time.},

  abstract={This paper demonstrates that the waves produced on the surface of water can be used as the medium for a “Liquid State Machine” that pre-processes inputs so allowing a simple perceptron to solve the XOR problem and undertake speech recognition. Interference between waves allows non-linear parallel computation upon simultaneous sensory inputs. Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas Wolfgang Maass’ Liquid State Machine requires fine tuning of the spiking neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high complexity. Water achieves this “for free”, and does so without the time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An analogy is made between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural network.}

  year={2002},
  volume={14},
  number={11},
  pages={2531-2560},
  abstract={A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

Current-induced magnetization switching and effective fields are measured using Hall-bar devices. The switching efficiency, defined as a ratio of the areal anisotropy energy density to switching current density, increases with increasing the number of Co/Pt stacks. This trend is in accordance with the stacking number dependence of effective fields per unit current density. The effective spin-Hall angle of the Pt buffer layer for the sample with multiple Co/Pt stacks is significantly larger than that of Pt previously reported, suggesting a generation of SOT in Co/Pt multilayers. These results indicate that Co/Pt multilayers are promising for SOT-MRAM devices possessing high thermal stability and small switching current.}",

abstract = {Molecule-based reservoir computing (RC) is promising for achieving low power consumption neuromorphic computing, although the information-processing capability of small numbers of molecules is not clear. Here, we report a few- and single-molecule RC that uses the molecular vibration dynamics in the para-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) detected by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with tungsten oxide nanorod/silver nanoparticles. The Raman signals of the pMBA molecules, adsorbed at the SERS active site of the nanorod, were reversibly perturbated by the application of voltage-induced local pH changes near the molecules, and then used to perform time-series analysis tasks. Despite the small number of molecules used, our system achieved good performance, including \&gt;95\% accuracy in various nonlinear waveform transformations, 94.3\% accuracy in solving a second-order nonlinear dynamic system, and a prediction error of 25.0 milligrams per deciliter in a 15-minute-ahead blood glucose level prediction. Our work provides a concept of few-molecular computing with practical computation capabilities. Few- and single-molecule reservoir computing is demonstrated for various computations including blood glucose level prediction.}}

abstract={We are familiar with elementary particles that carry either negative or positive electric charge, such as electrons and protons, but there is no evidence of elementary particles with a net magnetic charge. Magnets tend to come with inseparable north and south poles, and there are no known magnetic monopoles despite concerted efforts to find them. But an intriguing theoretical study now proposes that magnetic monopoles may exist, not as elementary particles, but as emergent particles in exotic condensed matter magnetic systems such as 'spin ice'. The theory, based on an analogy to fractional electric charges seen, for example, in quantum Hall systems in two dimensions, can explain a mysterious phase transition that has been observed experimentally in spin ice. The cover, by Alessandro Canossa, depicts a magnetic monopole (red sphere) emerging from break-up of the dipole moment (arrows) of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom in spin ice.},

abstract = {We combine experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the low energy states and the emergence of topological defects in an artificial colloidal ice in the Cairo geometry. This type of geometry is characterized by a mixed coordination (z), with coexistence of both z = 3 and z = 4 vertices. We realize this particle ice by confining field tunable paramagnetic colloidal particles within a lattice of topographic double wells at a one to one filling using optical tweezers. By raising the interaction strength via an applied magnetic field, we find that the ice rule breaks down, and positive monopoles with charge  accumulate in the z = 4 vertices and are screened by negative ones () in the z = 3. The resulting, strongly coupled state remains disordered. Further, via analysis of the mean chirality associated to each pentagonal plaquette, we find that the disordered ensemble for this geometry is massively degenerate and it corresponds to a frustrated antiferrotoroid.}

For heating processes, the relevance of the concept of normal curves shows up clearly. They explain the appearance of hysteresis cycles and can be useful to interpret experimental results.}

Individual descriptions of these techniques exist, but a overview is still lacking. Here, we present a series of experimental results that compares all three implementations, and draw conclusions about the relation between a broad range of reservoir parameters and network dynamics, memory, node complexity and performance on a variety of benchmark tests with different characteristics. Next, we introduce a new measure for the reservoir dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents. Unlike previous measures in the literature, this measure is dependent on the dynamics of the reservoir in response to the inputs, and in the cases we tried, it indicates an optimal value for the global scaling of the weight matrix, irrespective of the standard measures. We also describe the Reservoir Computing Toolbox that was used for these experiments, which implements all the types of Reservoir Computing and allows the easy simulation of a wide range of reservoir topologies for a number of benchmarks.}

abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.}

abstract = {Abstract A set of topological arrangements of individual ferromagnetic islands in ideal and disordered artificial spin ice (ASI) arrays is investigated in order to evaluate how aspects of their field-driven reversal are affected by the model used. The set contains the pinwheel and square ice tilings, and thus a range of magnetic ordering and reversal properties are tested. It is found that a simple point dipole model performs relatively well for square ice, but it does not replicate the properties observed in recent experiments with pinwheel ice. Parameterization of the reversal barrier in a Stoner–Wohlfarth model improves upon this, but fails to capture aspects of the physics of ferromagnetic coupling observed in pinwheel structures which have been attributed to the non-Ising nature of the islands. In particular, spin canting is found to be important in pinwheel arrays, but not in square ones, due to their different symmetries. The authors' findings will improve the modeling of ASI structures for fundamental research and in applications which are reliant upon the ability to obtain and switch through known states using an externally applied field.},

In this work, we investigate key computational properties of ASI through micromagnetic simulations. Our nanomagnetic system exhibits a large number of reachable stable states and a wide range of available dynamics when perturbed by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that the system is able to store and process temporal input patterns. The emergent behavior is highly tunable by varying the parameters of the external field. Our findings highlight ASI as a very promising substrate for in-materio computation at the nanoscale.}",

  abstract = {According to Weiss's well-known theory, a ferromagnetic body in the absence of an external magnetic field must be spontaneously magnetised in such a way that the direction of magnetisation varies in an irregular manner in different portions of the body. It was originally assumed by Weiss that these portions coincide with the minute crystals of which the body is built up. That this is not so is clear from the fact that spontaneous magnetisation (as revealed by the existence of a Curie temperature) is present also in single crystals. We are thus forced to assume that a moderate-sized single crystal of a ferromagnetic body consists of a number of `elementary magnets' the resultant magnetic moment of which vanishes. This spontaneous subdivision of a ferromagnetic body into elementary magnets can be interpreted both qualitatively and quantitatively in the following manner.},

abstract = {A method for finding minimum energy paths of transitions in magnetic systems is presented. The path is optimized with respect to orientation of the magnetic vectors while their magnitudes are fixed or obtained from separate calculations. The curvature of the configuration space is taken into account by: (1) using geodesics to evaluate distances and displacements of the system during the optimization, and (2) projecting the path tangent and the magnetic force on the tangent space of the manifold defined by all possible orientations of the magnetic vectors. The method, named geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB), and its implementation are illustrated with calculations of complex transitions involving annihilation and creation of skyrmion and antivortex states. The lifetime of the latter was determined within harmonic transition state theory using a noncollinear extension of the Alexander-Anderson model.}

abstract={Two-dimensional arrays of magnetically coupled nanomagnets provide a mesoscopic platform for exploring collective phenomena as well as realizing a broad range of spintronic devices. In particular, the magnetic coupling plays a critical role in determining the nature of the cooperative behavior and providing new functionalities in nanomagnet-based devices. Here, we create coupled Ising-like nanomagnets in which the coupling between adjacent nanomagnetic regions can be reversibly converted between parallel and antiparallel through solid-state ionic gating. This is achieved with the voltage-control of the magnetic anisotropy in a nanosized region where the symmetric exchange interaction favors parallel alignment and the antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, favors antiparallel alignment of the nanomagnet magnetizations. Applying this concept to a two-dimensional lattice, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled phase transition in artificial spin ices. Furthermore, we achieve an addressable control of the individual couplings and realize an electrically programmable Ising network, which opens up new avenues to design nanomagnet-based logic devices and neuromorphic computers.},

abstract={In-materia reservoir computing (RC) leverages the intrinsic physical responses of functional materials to perform complex computational tasks. Magnetic metamaterials are exciting candidates for RC due to their huge state space, nonlinear emergent dynamics, and non-volatile memory. However, to be suitable for a broad range of tasks, the material system is required to exhibit a broad range of properties, and isolating these behaviours experimentally can often prove difficult. By using an electrically accessible device consisting of an array of interconnected magnetic nanorings- a system shown to exhibit complex emergent dynamics- here we show how reconfiguring the reservoir architecture allows exploitation of different aspects the system's dynamical behaviours. This is evidenced through state-of-the-art performance in diverse benchmark tasks with very different computational requirements, highlighting the additional computational configurability that can be obtained by altering the input/output architecture around the material system.},

Magnetic storage density is presently increasing steadily in almost the same way as electronic device size and circuitry are shrinking, and magnetism in general appears as a new contender for many novel computing applications that were considered traditionally beyond its range. Denser storage leads to finer magnetic grains and smaller size leads to magnetic grains so fine that they contain a single magnetic domain, i.e. a region in the material with a well-defined uniform magnetization best described with the mathematics of the SW model.}

In particular they plot the zero temperature phase diagram, which features, as well as the expected perpendicular and in-plane ferromagnetic phases, a series of unexpected perpendicular antiferromagnetic phases, although these are most important for anisotropy parameter values higher than the authors would expect to see in real monolayers. A mean field theory at finite temperatures predicts the existence of a first-order perpendicular to in-plane reorientation transition of the magnetization for certain values of the parameters. Computer simulations of this system were attempted, but were unsuccessful because of the large correlation lengths arising. The authors draw the tentative conclusion that straightforward Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation is not a practicable way to investigate this system, and note the important technical point that data parallelization of conventional Monte Carlo methods with infinitely long-range interactions is not possible.}

	abstract      = {While physical reservoir computing is a promising way to achieve low power consumption neuromorphic computing, its computational performance is still insufficient at a practical level. One promising approach to improving its performance is deep reservoir computing, in which the component reservoirs are multi-layered. However, all of the deep-reservoir schemes reported so far have been effective only for simulation reservoirs and limited physical reservoirs, and there have been no reports of nanodevice implementations. Here, as an ionics-based neuromorphic nanodevice implementation of deep-reservoir computing, we report a demonstration of deep physical reservoir computing with maximum of four layers using an ion gating reservoir, which is a small and high-performance physical reservoir. While the previously reported deep-reservoir scheme did not improve the performance of the ion gating reservoir, our deep-ion gating reservoir achieved a normalized mean squared error of 9.08 {\texttimes} 10−3 on a second-order nonlinear autoregressive moving average task, which is the best performance of any physical reservoir so far reported in this task. More importantly, the device outperformed full simulation reservoir computing. The dramatic performance improvement of the ion gating reservoir with our deep-reservoir computing architecture paves the way for high-performance, large-scale, physical neural network devices.}

	abstract      = {Physical reservoir computing utilizes a physical system as a computational resource. This nontraditional computing technique can be computationally powerful, without the need of costly training. Here, a Hopf oscillator is implemented as a reservoir computer by using a node-based architecture; however, this implementation does not use delayed feedback lines. This reservoir computer is still powerful, but it is considerably simpler and cheaper to implement as a physical Hopf oscillator. A non-periodic stochastic masking procedure is applied for this reservoir computer following the time multiplexing method. Due to the presence of noise, the Euler--Maruyama method is used to simulate the resulting stochastic differential equations that represent this reservoir computer. An analog electrical circuit is built to implement this Hopf oscillator reservoir computer experimentally. The information processing capability was tested numerically and experimentally by performing logical tasks, emulation tasks, and time series prediction tasks. This reservoir computer has several attractive features, including a simple design that is easy to implement, noise robustness, and a high computational ability for many different benchmark tasks. Since limit cycle oscillators model many physical systems, this architecture could be relatively easily applied in many contexts.}

We expect that the new technique will be especially valuable in Monte Carlo simulation of the time evolution of binary alloy systems. The new algorithm is essentially a reorganization of the standard algorithm.

Especially for rare earth metals, this interaction seems to be the only mechanism which can cause ferro- and antiferromagnetism. However Zener's works are unsatisfactory because his model is phenomenological and moreover does not involve antiferromagnetism and spin wave mode.Our paper considers this s-d interaction on a more rigorous basis. By a certain approximation, there appear long range exchange type interactions between d-electron spins and, in certain conditions both ferro- and antiferromagnetism appear. The excitations of spin wave modes are the same as those in the ordinary modes of the short range exchange force, viz, the energy of the spin wave excitations is proportional to q2 for ferromagnetism and q for antiferromagnetism in the region of small wave vector q. The T3/2 law for the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ferromagnetism is applicable up to very high temperatures, and this result is in good agreement with the results of experiments on metallic ferromagnetism.},

The inherent limitations of the GSSA include the time required for executing a single run and the need for multiple runs for parameter sweep exercises due to the stochastic nature of the simulation. Even very efficient variants of GSSA are prohibitively expensive to compute and perform parameter sweeps. Here we present a novel variant of the exact GSSA that is amenable to acceleration by using graphics processing units (GPUs). We parallelize the execution of a single realization across threads in a warp (fine-grained parallelism). A warp is a collection of threads that are executed synchronously on a single multi-processor. Warps executing in parallel on different multi-processors (coarse-grained parallelism) simultaneously generate multiple trajectories. Novel data-structures and algorithms reduce memory traffic, which is the bottleneck in computing the GSSA. Our benchmarks show an 8×−120× performance gain over various state-of-the-art serial algorithms when simulating different types of models.}

Next, we introduce a new measure for the reservoir dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents. Unlike previous measures in the literature, this measure is dependent on the dynamics of the reservoir in response to the inputs, and in the cases we tried, it indicates an optimal value for the global scaling of the weight matrix, irrespective of the standard measures. We also describe the Reservoir Computing Toolbox that was used for these experiments, which implements all the types of Reservoir Computing and allows the easy simulation of a wide range of reservoir topologies for a number of benchmarks.}

In this paper we investigate some of the main aspects that can be accounted for the success and limitations of this class of models. In particular, we propose complementary classes of factors related to contractivity and architecture of reservoirs and we study their relative relevance. First, we show the existence of a class of tasks for which ESN performance is independent of the architectural design. The effect of the Markovian factor, characterizing a significant class within these cases, is shown by introducing instances of easy/hard tasks for ESNs featured by contractivity of reservoir dynamics. In the complementary cases, for which architectural design is effective, we investigate and decompose the aspects of network design that allow a larger reservoir to progressively improve the predictive performance. In particular, we introduce four key architectural factors: input variability, multiple time-scales dynamics, non-linear interactions among units and regression in an augmented feature space. To investigate the quantitative effects of the different architectural factors within this class of tasks successfully approached by ESNs, variants of the basic ESN model are proposed and tested on instances of datasets of different nature and difficulty. Experimental evidences confirm the role of the Markovian factor and show that all the identified key architectural factors have a major role in determining ESN performances.}

This work reports on the neuromorphic dynamics of nanowire networks (NWNs), a unique brain-inspired system with synapse-like memristive junctions embedded within a recurrent neural network-like structure. Simulation and experiment elucidate how collective memristive switching gives rise to long-range transport pathways, drastically altering the network's global state via a discontinuous phase transition. The spatio-temporal properties of switching dynamics are found to be consistent with avalanches displaying power-law size and life-time distributions, with exponents obeying the crackling noise relationship, thus satisfying criteria for criticality, as observed in cortical neuronal cultures. Furthermore, NWNs adaptively respond to time varying stimuli, exhibiting diverse dynamics tunable from order to chaos. Dynamical states at the edge-of-chaos are found to optimise information processing for increasingly complex learning tasks. Overall, these results reveal a rich repertoire of emergent, collective neural-like dynamics in NWNs, thus demonstrating the potential for a neuromorphic advantage in information processing.}

We demonstrate how this complex, self-organizing chemical reaction network can perform several nonlinear classification tasks in parallel, predict the dynamics of other complex systems and achieve time-series forecasting. This in chemico information processing system provides proof of principle for the emergent computational capabilities of complex chemical reaction networks, paving the way for a new class of biomimetic information processing systems.}

	abstract      = {Artificial spin ice (ASI) are nanomagnetic metamaterials with a wide range of emergent properties. Through local interactions, the magnetization of the nanomagnets self-organize into extended magnetic domains. However, controlling when, where and how domains change has proven difficult, yet is crucial for technological applications. Here, we introduce astroid clocking, which offers significant control of ASI dynamics in both time and space. Astroid clocking unlocks a discrete, step-wise and gradual dynamical process within the metamaterial. Notably, our method employs global fields to selectively manipulate local features within the ASI. Sequences of these clock fields drive domain dynamics. We demonstrate, experimentally and in simulations, how astroid clocking of pinwheel ASI enables ferromagnetic domains to be gradually grown or reversed at will. Richer dynamics arise when the clock protocol allows both growth and reversal to occur simultaneously. With astroid clocking, complex spatio-temporal behaviors of magnetic metamaterials become easily controllable with high fidelity.}

Local interactions between the magnets gives rise to a range of complex collective behavior. The ferromagnets form large networks of nonlinear nodes, which in many ways resemble artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigate key computational properties of ASI through micromagnetic simulations. Our nanomagnetic system exhibits a large number of reachable stable states and a wide range of available dynamics when perturbed by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that the system is able to store and process temporal input patterns. The emergent behavior is highly tunable by varying the parameters of the external field. Our findings highlight ASI as a very promising substrate for in-materio computation at the nanoscale.},

	abstract      = {Nanomagnets are a promising low-power alternative to traditional computing. However, the successful implementation of nanomagnets in logic gates has been hindered so far by a lack of reliability. Here, we present a novel design with dipolar-coupled nanomagnets arranged on a square lattice to (i) support transfer of information and (ii) perform logic operations. We introduce a thermal protocol, using thermally active nanomagnets as a means to perform computation. Within this scheme, the nanomagnets are initialized by a global magnetic field and thermally relax on raising the temperature with a resistive heater. We demonstrate error-free transfer of information in chains of up to 19 square rings and we show a high level of reliability with successful gate operations of ∼94% across more than 2000 logic gates. Finally, we present a functionally complete prototype NAND/NOR logic gate that could be implemented for advanced logic operations. Here we support our experiments with simulations of the thermally averaged output and determine the optimal gate parameters. Our approach provides a new pathway to a long standing problem concerning reliability in the use of nanomagnets for computation.}

	abstract      = {Artificial spin ice (ASI) consisting patterned array of nano-magnets with frustrated dipolar interactions offers an excellent platform to study frustrated physics using direct imaging methods. Moreover, ASI often hosts a large number of nearly degenerated and non-volatile spin states that can be used for multi-bit data storage and neuromorphic computing. The realization of the device potential of ASI, however, critically relies on the capability of transport characterization of ASI, which has not been demonstrated so far. Using a tri-axial ASI system as the model system, we demonstrate that transport measurements can be used to distinguish the different spin states of the ASI system. Specifically, by fabricating a tri-layer structure consisting a permalloy base layer, a Cu spacer layer and the tri-axial ASI layer, we clearly resolve different spin states in the tri-axial ASI system using lateral transport measurements. We have further demonstrated that the tri-axial ASI system has all necessary required properties for reservoir computing, including rich spin configurations to store input signals, nonlinear response to input signals, and fading memory effect. The successful transport characterization of ASI opens up the prospect for novel device applications of ASI in multi-bit data storage and neuromorphic computing.}

A self-consistent mean-field theory is used to show how domains of ground state ordering form spontaneously, and how these evolve in the presence of disorder. The role of fluctuations is studied using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical modelling. Domain wall dynamics are shown to be driven by a biasing of random fluctuations towards processes that shrink closed domains, and fluctuations within domains are shown to generate isolated small excitations, which may stabilize as the effective temperature is lowered. Domain dynamics and fluctuations are determined by interaction strengths, which are controlled by inter-element spacing. The role of interaction strength is studied via experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. Our mean-field model is applicable to ferroelectric ‘spin’ ice, and we show that features similar to those of magnetic spin ice can be expected, but with different characteristic temperatures and rates.}

This article reports tunable emergent behaviors observed in domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under an applied rotating magnetic field. DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic ring arrays’ properties (e.g., non-linear behavior, “fading memory” to changes in field, fabrication repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in hardware. By way of example, simulations of ring arrays performing RC approaches 100\% success in classifying spoken digits for single speakers.}

In particular, the magnetic coupling plays a critical role in determining the nature of the cooperative behavior and providing new functionalities in nanomagnet-based devices. Here, we create coupled Ising-like nanomagnets in which the coupling between adjacent nanomagnetic regions can be reversibly converted between parallel and antiparallel through solid-state ionic gating. This is achieved with the voltage-control of the magnetic anisotropy in a nanosized region where the symmetric exchange interaction favors parallel alignment and the antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, favors antiparallel alignment of the nanomagnet magnetizations. Applying this concept to a two-dimensional lattice, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled phase transition in artificial spin ices. Furthermore, we achieve an addressable control of the individual couplings and realize an electrically programmable Ising network, which opens up new avenues to design nanomagnet-based logic devices and neuromorphic computers.}

We find a pronounced and diverse MC behaviour, the amplitude and functional dependence change when stretching the contact by subatomic distances.

	abstract      = {Long-range ordering is typically associated with a decrease in entropy. Yet, it can also be driven by increasing entropy in certain special cases. Here we demonstrate that artificial spin-ice arrays of single-domain nanomagnets can be designed to produce such entropy-driven order. We focus on the tetris artificial spin-ice structure, a highly frustrated array geometry with a zero-point Pauling entropy, which is formed by selectively creating regular vacancies on the canonical square ice lattice. We probe thermally active tetris artificial spin ice both experimentally and through simulations, measuring the magnetic moments of the individual nanomagnets. We find two-dimensional magnetic ordering in one subset of these moments, which we demonstrate to be induced by disorder (that is, increased entropy) in another subset of the moments. In contrast with other entropy-driven systems, the discrete degrees of freedom in tetris artificial spin ice are binary and are both designable and directly observable at the microscale, and the entropy of the system is precisely calculable in simulations. This example, in which the system's interactions and ground-state entropy are well defined, expands the experimental landscape for the study of entropy-driven ordering.}

In this work, we evaluate the performance of different pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) of the Curand library on a number of modern Nvidia GPU cards. As a numerical test, we generate pseudo-random number (PRN) sequences and obtain non-uniform distributions using the acceptance-rejection method. We consider GPU, CPU, and hybrid CPU/GPU implementations. For the GPU, we additionally consider two different implementations using the host and device application programming interfaces (API). We study how the performance depends on implementation parameters, including the number of threads per block and the number of blocks per streaming multiprocessor. To achieve the fastest performance, one has to minimize the time consumed by PRNG seed setup and state update. The duration of seed setup time increases with the number of threads, while PRNG state update decreases. Hence, the fastest performance is achieved by the optimal balance of these opposing effects.}

To process information, neuromorphic computing directly mimics the operation of biological neurons in a human brain. To effectively imitate biological neurons with electrical devices, memristor-based artificial neurons attract attention because of their simple structure, energy efficiency, and excellent scalability. However, memristor's non-reliability issues have been one of the main obstacles for the development of memristor-based artificial neurons and neuromorphic computings. Here, we show a memristor 1R cross-bar array without transistor devices for individual memristor access with low variation, 100{\%} yield, large dynamic range, and fast speed for artificial neuron and neuromorphic computing. Based on the developed memristor, we experimentally demonstrate a memristor-based neuron with leaky-integrate and fire property with excellent reliability. Furthermore, we develop a neuro-memristive computing system based on the short-term memory effect of the developed memristor for efficient processing of sequential data. Our neuro-memristive computing system successfully trains and generates bio-medical sequential data (antimicrobial peptides) while using a small number of training parameters. Our results open up the possibility of memristor-based artificial neurons and neuromorphic computing systems, which are essential for energy-efficient edge computing devices.}

One of those techniques, reservoir computing (RC), is a decade old and has achieved state-of-the-art performance for processing sequential data. Dedicated hardware realizations of RC could enable speed gains and power savings. Here we propose the first integrated passive silicon photonics reservoir. We demonstrate experimentally and through simulations that, thanks to the RC paradigm, this generic chip can be used to perform arbitrary Boolean logic operations with memory as well as 5-bit header recognition up to 12.5{\thinspace}Gbit{\thinspace}s−1, without power consumption in the reservoir. It can also perform isolated spoken digit recognition. Our realization exploits optical phase for computing. It is scalable to larger networks and much higher bitrates, up to speeds >100{\thinspace}Gbit{\thinspace}s−1. These results pave the way for the application of integrated photonic RC for a wide range of applications.}

However, so far, such systems remain mainly frozen below their magnet's Curie temperature, unable to explore their potential-energy landscape through thermal fluctuations. Here we demonstrate the creation of thermally active finite artificial spin-ice systems and the observation of magnetic fluctuations in real time and space. We show that the subsequent magnetization dynamics can be entirely understood from the underlying dipolar energy landscape, and demonstrate that both the energy scale and the complexity of the landscape affect the temporal and spatial nature of the observed configurational changes. This work paves the way for the in situ study of thermally induced magnetic relaxation processes and delivers a controlled route to the lowest-energy state in extended two-dimensional artificial spin-ice systems.}

It is also uniquely well-aligned to in materio computing realisations that allow the inherent memory and non-linear responses of functional materials to be directly exploited for computation. We have previously shown that square arrays of interconnected magnetic nanorings are attractive candidates for in materio RC, and experimentally demonstrated their strong performance in a range of benchmark tasks (Dawidek et al 2021 Adv. Funct. Mater. 31 2008389, Vidamour et al 2022 Nanotechnology 33 485203, Vidamour et al 2023 Commun. Phys. 6 230). Here, we extend these studies to other lattice arrangements of rings, including trigonal and Kagome grids, to explore how these affect both the magnetic behaviours of the arrays, and their computational properties. We show that while lattice geometry substantially affects the microstate behaviour of the arrays, these differences manifest less profoundly when averaging magnetic behaviour across the arrays. Consequently the computational properties (as measured using task agnostic metrics) of devices with a single electrical readout are found to be only subtly different, with the approach used to time-multiplex data into and out of the arrays having a stronger effect on properties than the lattice geometry. However, we also find that hybrid reservoirs that combine the outputs from arrays with different lattice geometries show enhanced computational properties compared to any single array.}

The set contains the pinwheel and square ice tilings, and thus a range of magnetic ordering and reversal properties are tested. It is found that a simple point dipole model performs relatively well for square ice, but it does not replicate the properties observed in recent experiments with pinwheel ice. Parameterization of the reversal barrier in a Stoner–Wohlfarth model improves upon this, but fails to capture aspects of the physics of ferromagnetic coupling observed in pinwheel structures which have been attributed to the non-Ising nature of the islands. In particular, spin canting is found to be important in pinwheel arrays, but not in square ones, due to their different symmetries. The authors' findings will improve the modeling of ASI structures for fundamental research and in applications which are reliant upon the ability to obtain and switch through known states using an externally applied field.}

Here we report the imaging of the magnetic states of a thermally active artificial magnetic ice that reveal the fingerprints of a spin fragmentation process. This fragmentation corresponds to a splitting of the magnetic degree of freedom into two channels and is evidenced in both real and reciprocal space. Furthermore, the internal organization of both channels is interpreted within the framework of a hybrid spin--charge model that directly emerges from the parent spin model of the kagome dipolar spin ice. Our experimental and theoretical results provide insights into the physics of frustrated magnets and deepen our understanding of emergent fields through the use of tailor-made magnetism.}

Recently, artificial neurons based on memristors have been developed, but with limited bio-realistic dynamics and no direct interaction with the artificial synapses in an integrated network. Here we show that a diffusive memristor based on silver nanoparticles in a dielectric film can be used to create an artificial neuron with stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics and tunable integration time, which is determined by silver migration alone or its interaction with circuit capacitance. We integrate these neurons with nonvolatile memristive synapses to build fully memristive artificial neural networks. With these integrated networks, we experimentally demonstrate unsupervised synaptic weight updating and pattern classification.}

However, how geometric constrains influence the topological properties of the lattices is still unclear. Here we show that a geometric transformation between two mixed coordination lattices, from Shakti to Cairo in an artificial colloidal ice, leads to a breakdown of the ice rule in all but one specific geometry. We observe a transfer of topological charge among sublattices which can be controlled in sign and intensity, vanishing at the ice-rule point. These unusual topological effects are absent in magnetic spin ices and they are due to collective, non-local geometric frustration in the particle ice. By merging numerical simulations, theory and experiments, we demonstrate how the charge transfer occurs in the Cairo geometry. The broader implication of our results is that we demonstrate how geometric constraints can control the topological properties of a mesoscopic colloidal system.}

We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional Hölder like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization.}

The potential for engineering applications is illustrated by equalizing a communication channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders of magnitude.}

The quality of the fixed network, called reservoir, is the most important factor that determines the performance of the RC system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the hierarchical reservoir structure on the properties of the reservoir and the performance of the RC system. Analogous to deep neural networks, stacking sub-reservoirs in series is an efficient way to enhance the nonlinearity of data transformation to high-dimensional space and expand the diversity of temporal information captured by the reservoir. These deep reservoir systems offer better performance when compared to simply increasing the size of the reservoir or the number of sub-reservoirs. Low frequency components are mainly captured by the sub-reservoirs in later stage of the deep reservoir structure, similar to observations that more abstract information can be extracted by layers in the late stage of deep neural networks. When the total size of the reservoir is fixed, tradeoff between the number of sub-reservoirs and the size of each sub-reservoir needs to be carefully considered, due to the degraded ability of individual sub-reservoirs at small sizes. Improved performance of the deep reservoir structure alleviates the difficulty of implementing the RC system on hardware systems.}

We realize this particle ice by confining field tunable paramagnetic colloidal particles within a lattice of topographic double wells at a one to one filling using optical tweezers. By raising the interaction strength via an applied magnetic field, we find that the ice rule breaks down, and positive monopoles with charge  accumulate in the z = 4 vertices and are screened by negative ones () in the z = 3. The resulting, strongly coupled state remains disordered. Further, via analysis of the mean chirality associated to each pentagonal plaquette, we find that the disordered ensemble for this geometry is massively degenerate and it corresponds to a frustrated antiferrotoroid.}

This barrier is formed by magnetic anisotropies in the material and may be surmounted typically after 109-1012 attempts per second by thermal fluctuations. In a first step, the associated switching rate may be described by a Néel-Brown-Arrhenius law, in which the energy barrier is assumed as constant for a given temperature. Yet, magnetic anisotropies in general depend on temperature themselves which is known to modify the Néel-Brown-Arrhenius law. We illustrate quantitatively the implications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in particular for the interpretation of the prefactor as an attempt frequency. In particular, we show that realistic numbers for the attempt frequency are obtained when the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is taken into account.}

	abstract      = {Embodiment has led to a revolution in robotics by not thinking of the robot body and its controller as two separate units, but taking into account the interaction of the body with its environment. By investigating the effect of the body on the overall control computation, it has been suggested that the body is effectively performing computations, leading to the term morphological computation. Recent work has linked this to the field of reservoir computing, allowing one to endow morphologies with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a family of highly dynamic body structures, called tensegrity structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of “brains.” These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures, we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices of how to implement control in the body-brain composite. We show that tensegrity structures can maintain complex gaits with linear feedback control and that external feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the control loop. The various linear learning rules we consider differ in biological plausibility, and no specific assumptions are made on how to implement the feedback in a physical system.},

Recent experiments have shown that a Coulomb gas of magnetic charges really does exist at low temperature in these materials and this discovery provides a new perspective on otherwise largely inaccessible phenomenology. In this paper, after a review of the different spin ice models, we present detailed results describing the diffusive dynamics of monopole particles starting both from the dipolar spin ice model and directly from a Coulomb gas within the grand canonical ensemble. The diffusive quasi-particle dynamics of real spin ice materials within the ‘quantum tunnelling’ regime is modelled with Metropolis dynamics, with the particles constrained to move along an underlying network of oriented paths, which are classical analogues of the Dirac strings connecting pairs of Dirac monopoles.}

Magnets tend to come with inseparable north and south poles, and there are no known magnetic monopoles despite concerted efforts to find them. But an intriguing theoretical study now proposes that magnetic monopoles may exist, not as elementary particles, but as emergent particles in exotic condensed matter magnetic systems such as 'spin ice'. The theory, based on an analogy to fractional electric charges seen, for example, in quantum Hall systems in two dimensions, can explain a mysterious phase transition that has been observed experimentally in spin ice. The cover, by Alessandro Canossa, depicts a magnetic monopole (red sphere) emerging from break-up of the dipole moment (arrows) of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom in spin ice.}

	abstract      = {Spin--orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching shows promise for realizing ultrafast and reliable spintronics devices. Bipolar switching of the perpendicular magnetization by the SOT is achieved under an in-plane magnetic field collinear with an applied current. Typical structures studied so far comprise a nonmagnet/ferromagnet (NM/FM) bilayer, where the spin Hall effect in the NM is responsible for the switching. Here we show that an antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AFM/FM) bilayer system also exhibits a SOT large enough to switch the magnetization of the FM. In this material system, thanks to the exchange bias of the AFM, we observe the switching in the absence of an applied field by using an antiferromagnetic PtMn and ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayer with a perpendicular easy axis. Furthermore, tailoring the stack achieves a memristor-like behaviour where a portion of the reversed magnetization can be controlled in an analogue manner. The AFM/FM system is thus a promising building block for SOT devices as well as providing an attractive pathway towards neuromorphic computing.}

Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.}

	abstract      = {A method for finding minimum energy paths of transitions in magnetic systems is presented. The path is optimized with respect to orientation of the magnetic vectors while their magnitudes are fixed or obtained from separate calculations. The curvature of the configuration space is taken into account by: (1) using geodesics to evaluate distances and displacements of the system during the optimization, and (2) projecting the path tangent and the magnetic force on the tangent space of the manifold defined by all possible orientations of the magnetic vectors. The method, named geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB), and its implementation are illustrated with calculations of complex transitions involving annihilation and creation of skyrmion and antivortex states. The lifetime of the latter was determined within harmonic transition state theory using a noncollinear extension of the Alexander-Anderson model.}

We propose joining various reservoirs together as an approach to solving this problem, simulating physical reservoirs with Echo State Networks (ESNs). We investigate various methods of combining ESNs to form larger reservoirs, including a method that we dub Restricted ESNs. We provide a notation for describing Restricted ESNs, and use it to benchmark a standard ESN against restricted ones. We investigate two methods to keep the weight matrix density consistent when comparing a Restricted ESN to a standard one, which we call overall consistency and patch consistency. We benchmark restricted ESNs on NARMA10 and the sunspot prediction benchmark, and find that restricted ESNs perform similarly to standard ones. We present some application scenarios in which restricted ESNs may offer advantages over standard ESNs. We then test restricted ESNs on a version of the multi-timescale Multiple Superimposed Sines tasks, in order to establish a baseline performance that can be improved upon in further work. We conclude that we can scale up reservoir performance by linking small homogeneous subreservoirs together without significant loss in performance over a single large reservoir, justifying future work on using heterogeneous subreservoirs for greater flexibility.}

This development will enable miniaturisation of the neurons to the molecular level, leading to a range of applications including monitoring of changes in materials or structures. The system is based around the optical properties of quantum dots. The paper will report on experimental work on systems using Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum dots and on the various methods to render the systems sensitive to pH, redox potential or specific ion concentration. Once the quantum dot-based systems are rendered sensitive to these triggers they can provide a distributed array that can monitor and transmit information on changes within the material.}

This set of obstacles has promulgated a search for alternative, energy efficient approaches to computing inspired by natural systems including the mammalian brain. Atomic switch network (ASN) devices are a unique platform specifically developed to overcome these current barriers to realize adaptive neuromorphic technology. ASNs are composed of a massively interconnected network of atomic switches with a density of ∼109 units/cm2 and are structurally reminiscent of the neocortex of the brain. ASNs possess both the intrinsic capabilities of individual memristive switches, such as memory capacity and multi-state switching, and the characteristics of large-scale complex systems, such as power-law dynamics and non-linear transformations of input signals. Here we describe the successful nanoarchitectonic fabrication of next-generation ASN devices using combined top-down and bottom-up processing and experimentally demonstrate their utility as reservoir computing hardware. Leveraging their intrinsic dynamics and transformative input/output (I/O) behavior enabled waveform regression of periodic signals in the absence of embedded algorithms, further supporting the potential utility of ASN technology as a platform for unconventional approaches to computing.}

Weights and interconnections of the network are realized by a magnetic-field pattern that is applied on the spin-wave propagating substrate and scatters the spin waves. The interference of the scattered waves creates a mapping between the wave sources and detectors. Training the neural network is equivalent to finding the field pattern that realizes the desired input-output mapping. A custom-built micromagnetic solver, based on the Pytorch machine learning framework, is used to inverse-design the scatterer. We show that the behavior of spin waves transitions from linear to nonlinear interference at high intensities and that its computational power greatly increases in the nonlinear regime. We envision small-scale, compact and low-power neural networks that perform their entire function in the spin-wave domain.}

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention.

Classic ESNs suffer from two limitations; hyperparameter selection and learning of multiple temporal and spatial scales. To learn multiple scales, hierarchies are proposed, and to overcome manual tuning, optimisation is used. However, the autonomous design of hierarchies and optimisation of multi-reservoir systems has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, an evolvable architecture is proposed called Reservoir-of-Reservoirs (RoR) where sub-networks of neurons (ESNs) are interconnected to form the reservoir. The design of each sub-network, hyperparameters, global connectivity and its hierarchical structure are evolved using a genetic algorithm (GA) called the Microbial GA.To evaluate the RoR and microbial GA, single networks and other hierarchical ESNs are evolved. The results show the microbial GA can dramatically increase the performance of single networks compared to other optimisation techniques. The evolutionary process also leads to competitive results with RoRs and other hierarchical ESNs, despite having fewer connections than a single network. In the final section, it is revealed that the RoR architecture may learn generalised features other architectures cannot, offering improvements in network generalisation to other tasks.},

Neuromorphic devices, and in particular reservoir computing architectures, utilize the inherent properties of physical systems to implement machine learning algorithms and so have the potential to be much more efficient. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of individual domain walls in magnetic nanowires are suitable for implementing the reservoir computing paradigm in hardware. We modelled the dynamics of a domain wall placed between two anti-notches in a nickel nanowire using both a 1D collective coordinates model and micromagnetic simulations. When driven by an oscillating magnetic field, the domain exhibits non-linear dynamics within the potential well created by the anti-notches that are analogous to those of the Duffing oscillator. We exploit the domain wall dynamics for reservoir computing by modulating the amplitude of the applied magnetic field to inject time-multiplexed input signals into the reservoir, and show how this allows us to perform machine learning tasks including: the classification of (1) sine and square waves; (2) spoken digits; and (3) non-temporal 2D toy data and hand written digits. Our work lays the foundation for the creation of nanoscale neuromorphic devices in which individual magnetic domain walls are used to perform complex data analysis tasks.}

Physical reservoir computing, a subset of neuromorphic computing, faces limitations due to its reliance on single systems. This constrains output dimensionality and dynamic range, limiting performance to a narrow range of tasks. Here, we engineer a suite of nanomagnetic array physical reservoirs and interconnect them in parallel and series to create a multilayer neural network architecture. The output of one reservoir is recorded, scaled and virtually fed as input to the next reservoir. This networked approach increases output dimensionality, internal dynamics and computational performance. We demonstrate that a physical neuromorphic system can achieve an overparameterised state, facilitating meta-learning on small training sets and yielding strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Our approach's efficacy is further demonstrated through few-shot learning, where the system rapidly adapts to new tasks.}

Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section.}

	abstract      = {Reservoir computing (RC) has received recent interest because reservoir weights do not need to be trained, enabling extremely low-resource consumption implementations, which could have a transformative impact on edge computing and in-situ learning where resources are severely constrained. Ideally, a natural hardware reservoir should be passive, minimal, expressive, and feasible; to date, proposed hardware reservoirs have had difficulty meeting all of these criteria. We, therefore, propose a reservoir that meets all of these criteria by leveraging the passive interactions of dipole-coupled, frustrated nanomagnets. The frustration significantly increases the number of stable reservoir states, enriching reservoir dynamics, and as such these frustrated nanomagnets fulfill all of the criteria for a natural hardware reservoir. We likewise propose a complete frustrated nanomagnet reservoir computing (NMRC) system with low-power complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry to interface with the reservoir, and initial experimental results demonstrate the reservoir's feasibility. The reservoir is verified with micromagnetic simulations on three separate tasks demonstrating expressivity. The proposed system is compared with a CMOS echo state network (ESN), demonstrating an overall resource decrease by a factor of over 10,000,000, demonstrating that because NMRC is naturally passive and minimal it has the potential to be extremely resource efficient.}

Interference between waves allows non-linear parallel computation upon simultaneous sensory inputs. Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas Wolfgang Maass’ Liquid State Machine requires fine tuning of the spiking neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high complexity. Water achieves this “for free”, and does so without the time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An analogy is made between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural network.}

The Co thickness (T) dependence of the anisotropy energy (Ku∼T) and the effective anisotropy field (HK∼1/T) in Pd/Co LS support an interfacial anisotropy as the source of the perpendicular magnetic easy axis. In contrast, the anisotropy is independent of Co thickness for thin Co layers in Pt/Co LS, and thus the mechanism for the perpendicular easy axis is thought to be different.

A method for building physical reservoirs from electrochemical reactions is provided, and the potential of chemical dynamics as computing resources is shown. The essence of signal processing in such systems includes various degrees of ionic currents which pass through the solution as well as the electrochemical current detected based on a multiway data acquisition system to achieve switchable and parallel testing. The results show that they have respective advantages in periodic signals and temporal dynamic signals. Polyoxometalate molecule in the solution increases the diversity of the response current and thus improves their abilities to predict periodic signals. Conversely, distilled water exhibits great computing power in solving a second-order nonlinear problem. It is expected that these results will lead to further exploration of ionic conductance as a nonlinear dynamical system and provide more support for novel devices as computing resources.}

	abstract      = {The magnetization reversal process of interconnected pentagonal spin ice systems was investigated using micromagnetic simulations and experimental measurements. Five different systems were investigated, beginning with the interconnected Shakti lattice and introducing deformations with the idea of obtaining pentagonal tiling (belonging to the P4 group) until reaching an interconnected square lattice. In all pentagonal lattices, ferromagnetic domains are pinned, acting as isolated domains in an antiferromagnetic lattice, with Cairo tiling being the lattice that allows pinning more domains. Experimental measurements on a Cairo lattice of larger dimensions show that the shape of the hysteresis curve is invariant to the size of the bars that make up the interconnected pentagonal spin ice systems.}

The Strategy was implemented in a two-state reconstruction process by first inputting the time series data to the model separately. Once, the time data passes through the reservoirs and is activated by the SNA activation function, the new state for the reservoirs is created. The state is input to the next layer, and the concatenate states module saves. Pairs of states are selected from the activated multi-layer reservoirs and input into the state reconstruction module. Multiple input states are transformed through the state reconstruction module and finally saved to the concatenate state module. Two evaluation metrics were used to benchmark against three other ESNs with SNA activation functions to achieve better prediction accuracy.}

It is believed to have a lower power budget and a higher efficiency in performing cognitive tasks, and is arguably the most promising approaches for next-generation artificial intelligence. Despite the potentials, progress of neuromorphic computing is constrained by a lack of dedicated hardware. Spintronics is a fast-evolving discipline that exploits the spin degree of freedom in electronics. The interplay of magnetic and electrical properties of spintronic devices gives rise to a wide range of amazing phenomena, which are both intrinsically conducive to neuromorphic computing and highly compatible with conventional manufacturing technologies. Here, the development of neuromorphic computing with reference to spintronics is reviewed. The state-of-the-art spintronic technologies, such as the magnetic tunnel junction, spin–orbit torque, domain wall propagation, magnetic skyrmions, and antiferromagnet, are highlighted and how they can used for artificial neurons and synapses in different artificial neural networks are discussed. The technical challenges to be overcome for realizing more powerful all-spin artificial neural networks are also evaluated.}

Here, we use a phenomenological model to demonstrate that such reservoirs can be optimised for classification tasks by tuning hyperparameters that control the scaling and input-rate of data into the system using rotating magnetic fields. We use task-independent metrics to assess the rings’ computational capabilities at each set of these hyperparameters and show how these metrics correlate directly to performance in spoken and written digit recognition tasks. We then show that these metrics, and performance in tasks, can be further improved by expanding the reservoir’s output to include multiple, concurrent measures of the ring arrays’ magnetic states.}

	abstract      = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.}

Basic understanding of a working principle in reservoir computing can be expected to shed light on how information is stored and processed in nonlinear dynamical systems, potentially leading to progress in a broad range of nonlinear sciences. As a first step toward this goal, from the viewpoint of nonlinear physics and information theory, we study the memory-nonlinearity trade-off uncovered by Dambre et al. (2012). Focusing on a variational equation, we clarify a dynamical mechanism behind the trade-off, which illustrates why nonlinear dynamics degrades memory stored in dynamical system in general. Moreover, based on the trade-off, we propose a mixture reservoir endowed with both linear and nonlinear dynamics and show that it improves the performance of information processing. Interestingly, for some tasks, significant improvements are observed by adding a few linear dynamics to the nonlinear dynamical system. By employing the echo state network model, the effect of the mixture reservoir is numerically verified for a simple function approximation task and for more complex tasks.}

	abstract      = {Artificial spin ice (ASI) are systems of coupled nanomagnets arranged on a 2D lattice. ASIs are promising computing substrates due to the rich variety of emergent behavior, accompanied by considerable control and flexibility. Computational models may exploit the small-scale dynamics of the individual elements, or large-scale emergent behavior of the resulting metamaterial. We investigate the computational capabilities of “pinwheel” ASI, whose emergent ferromagnetic patterns can be observed at different scales. Within a reservoir computing framework, we examine how key system parameters affect performance using well-established reservoir quality metrics. As reservoir output, we consider system state at different granularities, ranging from individual magnets to the collective state of multiple magnets. Our results show that pinwheel ASI exhibits excellent computing capacity, including evidence of fading memory. Interestingly, a wide range of output granularities result in good performance, offering new insights into the scalability and robustness of reservoirs based on self-organized collective behavior. The apparent flexibility in output granularity show that ASIs have computational properties at different abstraction levels, from the small-scale dynamics of simple elements, to the large-scale spatial patterns of the metamaterial.},

A possible solution to this problem is the development of new computing architectures, with nanoscale hardware components that use their physical properties to emulate the behavior of neurons. In spite of multiple theoretical proposals, there have been only a limited number of experimental demonstrations of brain-inspired computing with nanoscale neurons. Here we describe such demonstrations using nanoscale spin-torque oscillators, which exhibit key features of neurons, in a reservoir computing approach. This approach offers an interesting platform to test these components, because a single component can emulate a whole neural network. Using this method, we classify sine and square waveforms perfectly and achieve spoken-digit recognition with state of the art results. We illustrate optimization of the oscillator's operating regime with sine/square classification.}

The reservoir is followed by a readout layer that can analyze the extracted features to accomplish tasks such as inference and classification. RC systems inherently exhibit an advantage, since the training is only performed at the readout layer, and therefore they are able to compute complicated temporal data with a low training cost. Herein, a physical reservoir computing system using diffusive memristor-based reservoir and drift memristor-based readout layer is experimentally implemented. The rich nonlinear dynamic behavior exhibited by a diffusive memristor due to Ag migration and the robust in situ training of drift memristor arrays makes the combined system ideal for temporal pattern classification. It is then demonstrated experimentally that the RC system can successfully identify handwritten digits from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83\%.}

We also change the uniaxial-anisotropy of the other nanomagnets using a voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy change to facilitate the flow of information, storage, and linear/nonlinear calculations. As a result, the reservoir computing output matrix was found to be trainable to perform AND/OR/XOR operations with an input delay of up to three bits.}

Magnetic solitons carry information through the networks, and an applied oscillating magnetic field feeds energy into the system and serves as a clock.

Such spin--orbit torque (SOT)-induced switching has been studied extensively in recent years and has shown higher efficiency than switching using conventional spin-transfer torque. Here we report the SOT-assisted switching in heavy metal/magnetic insulator systems. The experiments used a Pt/BaFe12O19 bilayer where the BaFe12O19 layer exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. As a charge current is passed through the Pt film, it produces a SOT that can control the up and down states of the remnant magnetization in the BaFe12O19 film when the film is magnetized by an in-plane magnetic field. It can reduce or increase the switching field of the BaFe12O19 film by as much as about 500{\thinspace}Oe when the film is switched with an out-of-plane field.}

The switching efficiency, defined as a ratio of the areal anisotropy energy density to switching current density, increases with increasing the number of Co/Pt stacks. This trend is in accordance with the stacking number dependence of effective fields per unit current density. The effective spin-Hall angle of the Pt buffer layer for the sample with multiple Co/Pt stacks is significantly larger than that of Pt previously reported, suggesting a generation of SOT in Co/Pt multilayers.

It was originally assumed by Weiss that these portions coincide with the minute crystals of which the body is built up. That this is not so is clear from the fact that spontaneous magnetisation (as revealed by the existence of a Curie temperature) is present also in single crystals. We are thus forced to assume that a moderate-sized single crystal of a ferromagnetic body consists of a number of `elementary magnets' the resultant magnetic moment of which vanishes. This spontaneous subdivision of a ferromagnetic body into elementary magnets can be interpreted both qualitatively and quantitatively in the following manner.}

This paper deals with the relation between magnetism and structure of thin films. We have chosen cobalt as a ferromagnetic layer and chromium as a bcc buffer. Magnetic and structural investigations have been led on epitaxial Co/Cr layers grown on MgO (001) substrates. The thickness of the cobalt layer varies from 0.75 to 20nm. Investigations on the cobalt layer by EXAFS and HRTEM give evidence for a bcc or a hcp structure depending on the cobalt thickness. Magnetic measurements using SQUID indicate that the saturation magnetisation per volume unit is constant for the layers. EELS experiments have been carried out to measure any evolution in the I(L3)/I(L2) ratio for ferromagnetic layers of different thickness. We discuss the influence of structural and magnetic contributions on the evolution of the ratio with the cobalt thickness.}

The cobalt layers were deposited at 450∘C at 1.5 torr chamber pressure of hydrogen for 15 min processing time with various precursor flow rates. X-ray diffraction studies of the cobalt films reveal both hcp and fcc peaks. The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) yields coercivity (Hc) 167 Oe and 364 Oe for 46 nm and 30 nm thickness layers respectively at room temperature and squareness (S) Mr/Ms(remanence/saturation of magnetisation) value of ∼ 1. The study of magnetic properties of the cobalt suggests that magnetisation is dependent on grain size and therefore thickness. The grain size was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Magnetic images were observed by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and analyzed in terms of domain structure. The surface domain structure was recorded with the tip lift height 100 nm so that the magnetic interactions arising produced the topography effect. Where there is repulsive interaction the intensity is recorded as a bright region and where the interaction is attractive the intensity is recorded as a dark region.}

However, long-term forecasting is difficult, particularly for cases where the underlying models and parameters are complex and unknown. Neural networks can effectively process features in temporal units and are attractive for such purposes. Reservoir computing, in particular, can offer efficient temporal processing of recurrent neural networks with a low training cost, and is thus well suited to time-series analysis and forecasting tasks. Here, we report a reservoir computing hardware system based on dynamic tungsten oxide (WOx) memristors that can efficiently process temporal data. The internal short-term memory effects of the WOx memristors allow the memristor-based reservoir to nonlinearly map temporal inputs into reservoir states, where the projected features can be readily processed by a linear readout function. We use the system to experimentally demonstrate two standard benchmarking tasks: isolated spoken-digit recognition with partial inputs, and chaotic system forecasting. A high classification accuracy of 99.2{\%} is obtained for spoken-digit recognition, and autonomous chaotic time-series forecasting has been demonstrated over the long term.}

	abstract      = {We present Hotspice, a Monte Carlo simulation software designed to capture the dynamics and equilibrium states of Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) systems with both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) geometries. An Ising-like model is used where each nanomagnet is represented as a macrospin, with switching events driven by thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic interactions, and external fields. To improve simulation accuracy, we explore the impact of several corrections to this model, concerning for example the calculation of the dipole interaction in IP and OOP ASI, as well as the impact of allowing asymmetric rather than symmetric energy barriers between stable states. We validate these enhancements by comparing simulation results with experimental data for pinwheel and kagome ASI lattices, demonstrating how these corrections enable a more accurate simulation of the behavior of these systems. We finish with a demonstration of ‘clocking’ in pinwheel and OOP square ASI as an example of reservoir computing. Program summary Program title: Hotspice CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/9c3rx36jvn.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/bvwaeyen/Hotspice Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python 3 Nature of problem: To tailor the complex phenomena in Artificial Spin Ice for a specific purpose, simulations are key to rapidly assess whether a given combination of system parameters will yield a desirable result. Therefore, a simulator capable of simulating systems containing thousands of magnets is needed, ideally requiring a minimal amount of input parameters. This is particularly important for use cases such as reservoir computing, where system-scale dynamics are of primary interest. Solution method: Hotspice approximates each single-domain nanomagnet as an Ising spin, associating energies with its various states and accounting for the magnetostatic interaction between all magnets. By calculating switching rates using the Néel-Arrhenius model, or flipping magnets based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the dynamics of ASI can be calculated for large arrays and over experimentally relevant timescales. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: While Hotspice is well-suited for large-scale ASI simulations, it relies on higher-level approximations which do not account for the detailed internal magnetization dynamics within individual magnets. To improve simulation accuracy, several model variants have been implemented which differ in their calculation of the magnetostatic interactions, the use of symmetric versus asymmetric energy barriers, and their choice of update algorithm.}

Instead, we should be investigating matter from the perspective of its natural computational capabilities.

	abstract      = {The Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) model is the simplest model that describes adequately the physics of fine magnetic grains, the magnetization of which can be used in digital magnetic storage (floppies, hard disks and tapes). Magnetic storage density is presently increasing steadily in almost the same way as electronic device size and circuitry are shrinking, and magnetism in general appears as a new contender for many novel computing applications that were considered traditionally beyond its range. Denser storage leads to finer magnetic grains and smaller size leads to magnetic grains so fine that they contain a single magnetic domain, i.e. a region in the material with a well-defined uniform magnetization best described with the mathematics of the SW model.}

Alongside the physical background, we provide hands-on examples of advanced magnetic systems, including detailed explanations of complete mumax3 input files (13 in total, often showing different ways to achieve things), and highlighting potential pitfalls where applicable. Specifically, we explore two approaches to incorporate spin–orbit torques in mumax simulations, considering the trade-off between versatility and speed. We also examine complex multilayer material stacks, including synthetic antiferromagnets, demonstrating different implementation methods that again vary in speed, versatility, and realism. A key criterion for selecting the optimal simulation strategy is its suitability for modeling systems where the magnetization varies significantly in the third dimension. The material covered in this Tutorial paper includes content developed for the mumax3 workshop presented during the summer of 2020 within the context of the IEEE online spintronics seminar, along with additional new topics. Throughout the explanations, we ensure broad applicability beyond specific examples.},

	abstract      = {In recent years, artificial neural networks have become the flagship algorithm of artificial intelligence1. In these systems, neuron activation functions are static, and computing is achieved through standard arithmetic operations. By contrast, a prominent branch of neuroinspired computing embraces the dynamical nature of the brain and proposes to endow each component of a neural network with dynamical functionality, such as oscillations, and to rely on emergent physical phenomena, such as synchronization2--6, for solving complex problems with small networks7--11. This approach is especially interesting for hardware implementations, because emerging nanoelectronic devices can provide compact and energy-efficient nonlinear auto-oscillators that mimic the periodic spiking activity of biological neurons12--16. The dynamical couplings between oscillators can then be used to mediate the synaptic communication between the artificial neurons. One challenge for using nanodevices in this way is to achieve learning, which requires fine control and tuning of their coupled oscillations17; the dynamical features of nanodevices can be difficult to control and prone to noise and variability18. Here we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic nano-oscillators---that is, the possibility of accurately controlling their frequency across a wide range, through electrical current and magnetic field---can be used to address this challenge. We successfully train a hardware network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the ability of these oscillators to synchronize. Our results demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with small hardware neural networks by endowing them with nonlinear dynamical features such as oscillations and synchronization.}

Since the first experimental realization of such a widefield NV microscope in 2010, the technology has seen rapid development and demonstration of applications in various areas across condensed matter physics, geoscience, and biology. This Perspective analyzes the strengths and shortcomings of widefield NV microscopy in order to identify the most promising applications and guide future development. We begin with a brief review of quantum sensing with ensembles of NV centers and the experimental implementation of widefield NV microscopy. We then compare this technology to alternative microscopy techniques commonly employed to probe magnetic materials and charge flow distributions. Current limitations in spatial resolution, measurement accuracy, magnetic sensitivity, operating conditions, and ease of use are discussed. Finally, we identify the technological advances that solve the aforementioned limitations and argue that their implementation would result in a practical, accessible, high-throughput widefield NV microscope.},

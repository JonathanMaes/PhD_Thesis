We find that at temperatures T < Tc, the critical temperature, the new technique is faster than the standard technique, being ten times faster at T = 0.588 Tc. We expect that the new technique will be especially valuable in Monte Carlo simulation of the time evolution of binary alloy systems. The new algorithm is essentially a reorganization of the standard algorithm. It accounts for the a priori probability of changing spins before, rather than after, choosing the spin or spins to change.}

An ESN consists of a large, fixed, recurrent "reservoir" network, from which the desired output is obtained by training suitable output connection weights. Determination of optimal output weights becomes a linear, uniquely solvable task of MSE minimization. This article reviews the basic ideas and describes an online adaptation scheme based on the RLS algorithm known from adaptive linear systems. As an example, a 10-th order NARMA system is adaptively identified. The known benefits of the RLS algorithms carry over from linear systems to nonlinear ones; specifically, the convergence rate and misadjustment can be determined at design time.},

Individual descriptions of these techniques exist, but a overview is still lacking. Here, we present a series of experimental results that compares all three implementations, and draw conclusions about the relation between a broad range of reservoir parameters and network dynamics, memory, node complexity and performance on a variety of benchmark tests with different characteristics. Next, we introduce a new measure for the reservoir dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents. Unlike previous measures in the literature, this measure is dependent on the dynamics of the reservoir in response to the inputs, and in the cases we tried, it indicates an optimal value for the global scaling of the weight matrix, irrespective of the standard measures. We also describe the Reservoir Computing Toolbox that was used for these experiments, which implements all the types of Reservoir Computing and allows the easy simulation of a wide range of reservoir topologies for a number of benchmarks.}

The use of physical matter leads the way toward energy-efficient devices capable of solving machine learning problems without having to build a system of millions of interconnected neurons. Proposed herein is a high-performance “skyrmion mixture reservoir” that implements the reservoir computing model with multidimensional inputs. This implementation solves spoken digit classification tasks with an overall model accuracy of 97.4\% and a < 1\% word error ratethe best performance ever reported for in materio reservoir computers. Due to the quality of the results and the low-power properties of magnetic texture reservoirs, it is evident that skyrmion fabrics are a compelling candidate for reservoir computing.}

Through local interactions, the magnetization of the nanomagnets self-organize into extended magnetic domains. However, controlling when, where and how domains change has proven difficult, yet is crucial for technological applications. Here, we introduce astroid clocking, which offers significant control of ASI dynamics in both time and space. Astroid clocking unlocks a discrete, step-wise and gradual dynamical process within the metamaterial. Notably, our method employs global fields to selectively manipulate local features within the ASI. Sequences of these clock fields drive domain dynamics. We demonstrate, experimentally and in simulations, how astroid clocking of pinwheel ASI enables ferromagnetic domains to be gradually grown or reversed at will. Richer dynamics arise when the clock protocol allows both growth and reversal to occur simultaneously. With astroid clocking, complex spatio-temporal behaviors of magnetic metamaterials become easily controllable with high fidelity.}

Local interactions between the magnets gives rise to a range of complex collective behavior. The ferromagnets form large networks of nonlinear nodes, which in many ways resemble artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigate key computational properties of ASI through micromagnetic simulations. Our nanomagnetic system exhibits a large number of reachable stable states and a wide range of available dynamics when perturbed by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that the system is able to store and process temporal input patterns. The emergent behavior is highly tunable by varying the parameters of the external field. Our findings highlight ASI as a very promising substrate for in-materio computation at the nanoscale.}},

This article reports tunable emergent behaviors observed in domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under an applied rotating magnetic field. DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic ring arrays’ properties (e.g., non-linear behavior, “fading memory” to changes in field, fabrication repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in hardware. By way of example, simulations of ring arrays performing RC approaches 100\% success in classifying spoken digits for single speakers.}

In particular, the magnetic coupling plays a critical role in determining the nature of the cooperative behavior and providing new functionalities in nanomagnet-based devices. Here, we create coupled Ising-like nanomagnets in which the coupling between adjacent nanomagnetic regions can be reversibly converted between parallel and antiparallel through solid-state ionic gating. This is achieved with the voltage-control of the magnetic anisotropy in a nanosized region where the symmetric exchange interaction favors parallel alignment and the antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, favors antiparallel alignment of the nanomagnet magnetizations. Applying this concept to a two-dimensional lattice, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled phase transition in artificial spin ices. Furthermore, we achieve an addressable control of the individual couplings and realize an electrically programmable Ising network, which opens up new avenues to design nanomagnet-based logic devices and neuromorphic computers.},

In this work, we evaluate the performance of different pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) of the Curand library on a number of modern Nvidia GPU cards. As a numerical test, we generate pseudo-random number (PRN) sequences and obtain non-uniform distributions using the acceptance-rejection method. We consider GPU, CPU, and hybrid CPU/GPU implementations. For the GPU, we additionally consider two different implementations using the host and device application programming interfaces (API). We study how the performance depends on implementation parameters, including the number of threads per block and the number of blocks per streaming multiprocessor. To achieve the fastest performance, one has to minimize the time consumed by PRNG seed setup and state update. The duration of seed setup time increases with the number of threads, while PRNG state update decreases. Hence, the fastest performance is achieved by the optimal balance of these opposing effects.}

Here, we report a few- and single-molecule RC that uses the molecular vibration dynamics in the para-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) detected by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with tungsten oxide nanorod/silver nanoparticles. The Raman signals of the pMBA molecules, adsorbed at the SERS active site of the nanorod, were reversibly perturbated by the application of voltage-induced local pH changes near the molecules, and then used to perform time-series analysis tasks. Despite the small number of molecules used, our system achieved good performance, including \&gt;95\% accuracy in various nonlinear waveform transformations, 94.3\% accuracy in solving a second-order nonlinear dynamic system, and a prediction error of 25.0 milligrams per deciliter in a 15-minute-ahead blood glucose level prediction. Our work provides a concept of few-molecular computing with practical computation capabilities. Few- and single-molecule reservoir computing is demonstrated for various computations including blood glucose level prediction.}

The set contains the pinwheel and square ice tilings, and thus a range of magnetic ordering and reversal properties are tested. It is found that a simple point dipole model performs relatively well for square ice, but it does not replicate the properties observed in recent experiments with pinwheel ice. Parameterization of the reversal barrier in a Stoner–Wohlfarth model improves upon this, but fails to capture aspects of the physics of ferromagnetic coupling observed in pinwheel structures which have been attributed to the non-Ising nature of the islands. In particular, spin canting is found to be important in pinwheel arrays, but not in square ones, due to their different symmetries. The authors' findings will improve the modeling of ASI structures for fundamental research and in applications which are reliant upon the ability to obtain and switch through known states using an externally applied field.}

However, how geometric constrains influence the topological properties of the lattices is still unclear. Here we show that a geometric transformation between two mixed coordination lattices, from Shakti to Cairo in an artificial colloidal ice, leads to a breakdown of the ice rule in all but one specific geometry. We observe a transfer of topological charge among sublattices which can be controlled in sign and intensity, vanishing at the ice-rule point. These unusual topological effects are absent in magnetic spin ices and they are due to collective, non-local geometric frustration in the particle ice. By merging numerical simulations, theory and experiments, we demonstrate how the charge transfer occurs in the Cairo geometry. The broader implication of our results is that we demonstrate how geometric constraints can control the topological properties of a mesoscopic colloidal system.}

This type of geometry is characterized by a mixed coordination (z), with coexistence of both z = 3 and z = 4 vertices. We realize this particle ice by confining field tunable paramagnetic colloidal particles within a lattice of topographic double wells at a one to one filling using optical tweezers. By raising the interaction strength via an applied magnetic field, we find that the ice rule breaks down, and positive monopoles with charge  accumulate in the z = 4 vertices and are screened by negative ones () in the z = 3. The resulting, strongly coupled state remains disordered. Further, via analysis of the mean chirality associated to each pentagonal plaquette, we find that the disordered ensemble for this geometry is massively degenerate and it corresponds to a frustrated antiferrotoroid.}

This barrier is formed by magnetic anisotropies in the material and may be surmounted typically after 109-1012 attempts per second by thermal fluctuations. In a first step, the associated switching rate may be described by a Néel-Brown-Arrhenius law, in which the energy barrier is assumed as constant for a given temperature. Yet, magnetic anisotropies in general depend on temperature themselves which is known to modify the Néel-Brown-Arrhenius law. We illustrate quantitatively the implications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in particular for the interpretation of the prefactor as an attempt frequency. In particular, we show that realistic numbers for the attempt frequency are obtained when the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is taken into account.}

	abstract      = {Domain walls (DWs) in magnetic nanowires are promising candidates for a variety of applications including Boolean/unconventional logic, memories, in-memory computing as well as magnetic sensors and biomagnetic implementations. They show rich physical behaviour and are controllable using a number of methods including magnetic fields, charge and spin currents and spin-orbit torques. In this review, we detail types of DWs in ferromagnetic nanowires and describe processes of manipulating their state. We look at the state of the art of DW applications and give our take on the their current status, technological feasibility and challenges.}

	abstract      = {One of the most remarkable examples of emergent quasi-particles is that of the ‘fractionalization’ of magnetic dipoles in the low energy configurations of materials known as ‘spin ice’ into free and unconfined magnetic monopoles interacting via Coulomb’s 1/r  law (Castelnovo et al 2008 Nature 451 42–5). Recent experiments have shown that a Coulomb gas of magnetic charges really does exist at low temperature in these materials and this discovery provides a new perspective on otherwise largely inaccessible phenomenology. In this paper, after a review of the different spin ice models, we present detailed results describing the diffusive dynamics of monopole particles starting both from the dipolar spin ice model and directly from a Coulomb gas within the grand canonical ensemble. The diffusive quasi-particle dynamics of real spin ice materials within the ‘quantum tunnelling’ regime is modelled with Metropolis dynamics, with the particles constrained to move along an underlying network of oriented paths, which are classical analogues of the Dirac strings connecting pairs of Dirac monopoles.}

Magnets tend to come with inseparable north and south poles, and there are no known magnetic monopoles despite concerted efforts to find them. But an intriguing theoretical study now proposes that magnetic monopoles may exist, not as elementary particles, but as emergent particles in exotic condensed matter magnetic systems such as 'spin ice'. The theory, based on an analogy to fractional electric charges seen, for example, in quantum Hall systems in two dimensions, can explain a mysterious phase transition that has been observed experimentally in spin ice. The cover, by Alessandro Canossa, depicts a magnetic monopole (red sphere) emerging from break-up of the dipole moment (arrows) of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom in spin ice.}

The exponent v is closely related to the fractal dimension and the information dimension, but its computation is considerably easier. Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.}

The path is optimized with respect to orientation of the magnetic vectors while their magnitudes are fixed or obtained from separate calculations. The curvature of the configuration space is taken into account by: (1) using geodesics to evaluate distances and displacements of the system during the optimization, and (2) projecting the path tangent and the magnetic force on the tangent space of the manifold defined by all possible orientations of the magnetic vectors. The method, named geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB), and its implementation are illustrated with calculations of complex transitions involving annihilation and creation of skyrmion and antivortex states. The lifetime of the latter was determined within harmonic transition state theory using a noncollinear extension of the Alexander-Anderson model.}

Interference between waves allows non-linear parallel computation upon simultaneous sensory inputs. Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas Wolfgang Maass’ Liquid State Machine requires fine tuning of the spiking neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high complexity. Water achieves this “for free”, and does so without the time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An analogy is made between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural network.}

	abstract      = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

	abstract      = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.}

Magnetic metamaterials are exciting candidates for RC due to their huge state space, nonlinear emergent dynamics, and non-volatile memory. However, to be suitable for a broad range of tasks, the material system is required to exhibit a broad range of properties, and isolating these behaviours experimentally can often prove difficult. By using an electrically accessible device consisting of an array of interconnected magnetic nanorings- a system shown to exhibit complex emergent dynamics- here we show how reconfiguring the reservoir architecture allows exploitation of different aspects the system's dynamical behaviours. This is evidenced through state-of-the-art performance in diverse benchmark tasks with very different computational requirements, highlighting the additional computational configurability that can be obtained by altering the input/output architecture around the material system.}

ASIs are promising computing substrates due to the rich variety of emergent behavior, accompanied by considerable control and flexibility. Computational models may exploit the small-scale dynamics of the individual elements, or large-scale emergent behavior of the resulting metamaterial. We investigate the computational capabilities of “pinwheel” ASI, whose emergent ferromagnetic patterns can be observed at different scales. Within a reservoir computing framework, we examine how key system parameters affect performance using well-established reservoir quality metrics. As reservoir output, we consider system state at different granularities, ranging from individual magnets to the collective state of multiple magnets. Our results show that pinwheel ASI exhibits excellent computing capacity, including evidence of fading memory. Interestingly, a wide range of output granularities result in good performance, offering new insights into the scalability and robustness of reservoirs based on self-organized collective behavior. The apparent flexibility in output granularity show that ASIs have computational properties at different abstraction levels, from the small-scale dynamics of simple elements, to the large-scale spatial patterns of the metamaterial.}},

	abstract      = {{Spin-orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching in Co/Pt multilayer structures with a Pt buffer layer is studied aiming to realize SOT-magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices with high thermal stability. Current-induced magnetization switching and effective fields are measured using Hall-bar devices. The switching efficiency, defined as a ratio of the areal anisotropy energy density to switching current density, increases with increasing the number of Co/Pt stacks. This trend is in accordance with the stacking number dependence of effective fields per unit current density. The effective spin-Hall angle of the Pt buffer layer for the sample with multiple Co/Pt stacks is significantly larger than that of Pt previously reported, suggesting a generation of SOT in Co/Pt multilayers. These results indicate that Co/Pt multilayers are promising for SOT-MRAM devices possessing high thermal stability and small switching current.}},

	abstract      = {According to Weiss's well-known theory, a ferromagnetic body in the absence of an external magnetic field must be spontaneously magnetised in such a way that the direction of magnetisation varies in an irregular manner in different portions of the body. It was originally assumed by Weiss that these portions coincide with the minute crystals of which the body is built up. That this is not so is clear from the fact that spontaneous magnetisation (as revealed by the existence of a Curie temperature) is present also in single crystals. We are thus forced to assume that a moderate-sized single crystal of a ferromagnetic body consists of a number of `elementary magnets' the resultant magnetic moment of which vanishes. This spontaneous subdivision of a ferromagnetic body into elementary magnets can be interpreted both qualitatively and quantitatively in the following manner.}

Instead, we should be investigating matter from the perspective of its natural computational capabilities. I also argue that we should investigate nonbiological substrates, since these are less complex in that they have not been tuned by evolution to have their particular properties. Only then we will understand both aspects of computation (logical and physical) required to understand the computation occurring in biological systems.}

Magnetic storage density is presently increasing steadily in almost the same way as electronic device size and circuitry are shrinking, and magnetism in general appears as a new contender for many novel computing applications that were considered traditionally beyond its range. Denser storage leads to finer magnetic grains and smaller size leads to magnetic grains so fine that they contain a single magnetic domain, i.e. a region in the material with a well-defined uniform magnetization best described with the mathematics of the SW model.}

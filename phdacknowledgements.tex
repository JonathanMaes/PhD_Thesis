\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\nameref{sec:Acknowledgements}}
First and foremost, I wish to thank my promotors, Bartel and Jonathan, for introducing me to this field, for giving me the opportunity to pursue this research and for guiding me over these four years.
My appreciation extends to the people of \spinengine, of whom I must especially thank Alex for our many fruitful discussions that enabled us to obtain a thorough understanding of the perpendicular-anisotropy ASI. \\\par

Furthermore, I thank the members of the jury --- Prof. Boone, Prof. Ryckebusch, Prof. Folven, Dr. Joos and Dr. Hrabec --- for taking the effort to read and evaluate this thesis. \\\par

I am also grateful to the past and present DyNaMaatjes and members of the department for the inspiring and enjoyable atmosphere they provide: our conversations, many lunches, and regular social events have made S1 feel like a home away from home --- definitely worth getting on the train to Ghent for.
\\\par

Last, but certainly not least, I feel very grateful for my parents, for Mishka$^\dagger$, and for Wickie, who make our house a true home. \\\par

I acknowledge thee.

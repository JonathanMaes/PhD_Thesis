\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\nameref{sec:Acknowledgements}}
I owe my deepest appreciation to my promotors, Bartel and Jonathan, for introducing me to this field, for giving me the opportunity to pursue this research and for guiding me over these four years.
My appreciation extends to the people of \spinengine, of whom I must especially thank Alex for our many fruitful discussions that enabled us to obtain a thorough understanding of the perpendicular-anisotropy ASI. \\\par

% TODO: thank Jury members
%I must also thank the members of the jury, [Prof. X, Prof. Y, Prof. Z and Prof. A], for their effort to read this thesis and evaluate it. \\\par

I am also grateful to the past and present DyNaMaatjes for the inspiring and enjoyable atmosphere they foster in our group, as well as the members of the department: our conversations, many lunches, and regular social events have made S1 feel like a home away from home --- definitely worth getting on the train to Ghent for.
\\\par

Last, but certainly not least, I feel immensely grateful for my parents, for Mishka$^\dagger$, and for Wickie, who make our house a true home. \\\par

I acknowledge thee.

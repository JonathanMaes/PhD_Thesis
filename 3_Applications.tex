Our main focus will be on out-of-plane systems. First, however, we will rather briefly discuss several in-plane cases.

\section{Reservoir computing in out-of-plane systems}
The main factor that attracted attention towards OOP ASI for RC, was that they allow very efficient and relatively simple input and read-out methods to be used.
Early on in the \spinengine project, methods to read the state of OOP ASI had already been demonstrated experimentally on a small scale by ETHZ/PSI.
However, their potential for RC had not yet been investigated.
As \hotspice is well-suited for the simulation of OOP ASI, this presented an appropriate use-case for the software developed in~\cref{ch:Hotspice}. % Furthermore, the other simulator developed by the consortium (flatspin) only supports in-plane magnetisation. Furthermore, \hotspice is more accurate for OOP ASI than IP ASI due to the high degree of symmetry in the former.
\par
Therefore, in this section \hotspice will be used to assess the viability and characteristics of a couple of methods to achieve RC in OOP ASI.
It will be shown that RC is indeed possible in such systems by using an appropriate input and readout protocol.
This section starts with a discussion of the basic properties of OOP ASI and the motivation for researching them.
Then, the section is divided into two main parts, discussing non-volatile and thermally active ASI. % At first, the fabricated OOP ASI were not thermally active, though ASI which spontaneously relaxed to a checkerboard state was achieved later.
\subsection{Characteristics of OOP ASI}
\subsubsection{Motivation} % Input and output
While it is possible to use an external field to switch both IP and OOP nanomagnets, this is undesirable in a real device due to stray fields and the need for bulky magnets.
The main allure of OOP ASI stems from the existence of efficient input and readout mechanisms for such OOP magnets.
Input can be applied via spin-orbit torque (SOT)~\cite{SOT_FM_AFM,SOTswitchingCoPt}, and the system can be read out using the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)~\cite{AHE}.
Both of these only require a current to be passed through an underlayer that is electrically connected to the sample, and were explained earlier in the introduction (\cref{sec:1:ASI_IO}).
% Nonetheless, external fields are often used for input anyway in the lab during the first stages of development, because they are easier to handle than the more complicated methods that would be used in a real device. By the end of the project, Alex had used SOT in his actual devices.

\subsubsection{Structure of OOP nanomagnets} % Co/Pt multilayer, energy contributions
\label{sec:3:OOP_nanomagnet_PMA}
Where IP magnets mostly rely on shape anisotropy to create an easy axis, OOP magnets can be realised using interfacial anisotropy between the ferromagnetic material and the substrate.
One example of this is found at the interface between \ce{Co} and \ce{Pt}, as was used in the experimental OOP ASI fabricated within the context of the \spinengine project.
This \idx{perpendicular magnetic anisotropy} (PMA) acts in the immediate vicinity of the interface, where the magnetisation then prefers to align perpendicular to said interface. \par
Typically, a number of \ce{Co}-\ce{Pt} interfaces are stacked vertically, with the number and thickness of \ce{Co} layers then controlling the OOP anisotropy.
The ferromagnetic layers in such stacks are typically made to be very thin for two main reasons.
Firstly, since the PMA only acts at the interface it does not increase for thicker layers.
Secondly, recall that the energy associated with \xref{shape anisotropy} increases with volume ($\EB=K_\mathrm{u}V$), so a maximal number of layers for a given amount of ferromagnetic material is preferable for PMA to counteract shape anisotropy. \par
Other factors contribute to the anisotropy as well, e.g. a non-linear dependence on the \ce{Pt} layer thickness due to the RKKY interaction~\cite{RKKY_RK,RKKY_K,RKKY_Y}.
However, this coupling is likely not dominant in a \ce{Co}-\ce{Pt} stack, as \ce{Pt} nearly satisfies the Stoner criterion~\cite{PtMagneticOrder}.
Since the \ce{Pt} is combined with a ferromagnetic material (\ce{Co}), it is thought that this induces a ferromagnetic coupling between \ce{Co} layers in spite of the RKKY interaction, for reasonable \ce{Pt} thicknesses~\cite{PerpendicularMagnetizationASI}.

\subsubsection{ASI ground state}
The ground state of any system being used for RC is of utmost importance; it dictates which input methods will induce desirable dynamics in the system and which input protocols will fall flat.
The ground state of most OOP spin ices is some form of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) ordering, because the dipolar interaction will always encourage opposite magnetisation between any two neighbouring OOP magnets.
Depending on the particular lattice upon which the OOP magnets are placed, this may (e.g. triangle/Cairo; \crefSubFigRef{fig:2:ASIs}{j,l}) or may not (e.g. square/honeycomb; \crefSubFigRef{fig:2:ASIs}{i,k}) induce frustration in the system.
If no frustration is present, the symmetry of the system imposes exactly two opposite ground states.
If frustration is present, no real ground state exists apart from local interactions, though the simple two-fold symmetry will still be present, as in any ASI.
For the OOP square-lattice ASI in particular, which is the lattice we will consider throughout this chapter, the ground state is an AFM checkerboard pattern of `up' ($\uparrow$) and `down' ($\downarrow$) magnetisation.

\subsubsection{Input and readout: experiment to simulation}
\paragraph{Input by spin-orbit torque}
In the experimental system, the intent was to switch the OOP magnets using SOT~\cite{SOTswitchingCoPt}.
Compared to an \xref{external magnetic field}, this allows far greater control over the stimulus applied for each input bit, and can more easily be integrated on-chip without generating stray fields. \par
Since \hotspice does not work with torques, but rather with switching energies, SOT can not directly be modelled as a torque.
However, the net desired effect of SOT in our application is deterministic switching of magnets, which can be achieved in the presence of in-plane symmetry breaking~\cite{SOT_Roadmap}. % SOT_Roadmap mentions symmetry breaking several times, very useful resource
Broken symmetry creates a preferential magnetisation direction, which can be modelled in \hotspice as an additional external field $B_z$.
This is a crude approximation to fit SOT into the Ising-like model; the modelled field $B_z$ is not necessarily related to the field-like SOT torque~\cite{SOT_firstprinciplesCoPt}, though the SOT current density is likely non-linearly related to the modelled field $B_z$.
% In the case without symmetry breaking, the effect may be modelled as a temporary reduction of the PMA, as in reality a sufficiently strong SOT (applied over multiple $\tau_0$) will push the magnetic moment in-plane~\cite{SOT_Roadmap}, after which it falls back randomly (with higher likelihood to the lowest energy state, I suppose). But this approach raises multiple additional questions: is it meaningful to reduce the barrier only slightly?

\paragraph{Readout by anomalous Hall effect}
In our paper~\cite{KUR-24}, \textit{A. Kurenkov} experimentally demonstrated electrical readout of the average magnetisation $\mavg$ using the anomalous Hall effect~\cite{AHE}.
Therefore, $\mavg$ can be used as a magnetic state readout in the simulations.
However, for reservoir computing purposes, multiple readout values are beneficial, so the average magnetisation of each lattice column was used for the readout $y_i(t)$. % Fig. 6a

A discussion about the experimental feasibility of such a grid of local readouts is given in Supplementary Information 7 of our paper~\cite{KUR-24}.
In short, by adding more electrodes to the Hall bar --- the layer underneath the ASI used to measure the magnetic state through the AHE --- inhomogeneities in the current density distribution result in different currents flowing through the different nanomagnets.
This consequently results in unequal contributions to the Hall resistance, providing a way to differentiate between the different magnets.
Individual states of the nanomagnets, not just $\mavg$, can be extracted through a set of linear operations as detailed in the aforementioned Supplementary Information.
In the context of reservoir computing, this means that the use of this readout approach with multiple electrodes can be computationally equivalent to knowing the exact magnetic configuration of the system.


%We will later notice that simple stimuli are not sufficient for RC in this system, and instead more complicated patterns will have to be used to meaningfully address the system. However, the practical implementation of such complicated stimuli requires more complicated current line layouts, which also cannot interfere with the readout. This proves to be a conundrum, which I will address later again.

\subsection{Thermally active OOP ASI}
\subsubsection{Energy contributions}
Thermally active OOP ASI are hard to manufacture, because they must strike a delicate balance between several strong energy contributions to end up in an OOP state with a net energy barrier of only several tens of $\kBT$ at most.
To appreciate this difficulty, let us first take a closer look at the various energy contributions in the system --- ranging from local anisotropy to large-scale interactions --- and their dependence on the geometrical structure of the OOP magnets.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy} constitutes the largest contribution to the total OOP anisotropy.
	Its interfacial origin and characteristics have been discussed earlier in this chapter (see \cref{sec:3:OOP_nanomagnet_PMA}). % Anisot E: \approx\SI{1.1e-16}{\joule}
	\item \textbf{Shape anisotropy}\indexlabel[nolabel]{shape anisotropy} of each layer due to their \xlabel[nolabel]{demagnetising field}.
	It is of a similar order of magnitude as the PMA, but of opposite sign, favouring an IP magnetisation rather than OOP.
	This contribution was also discussed earlier, see~\cref{sec:2:shape_anisotropy}~and~\ref{sec:3:OOP_nanomagnet_PMA}. % Demag E: \approx\SI{-1.6e-16}{\joule}
	\item \textbf{Inter-layer magnetostatic interaction}.
	The separate FM layers within a single stack also interact, as they can all be considered as separate vertically stacked magnets.
	This vertical stacking provides an additional contribution to the OOP anisotropy because, in general, the magnetisation of separate magnets prefers to point along the axis connecting those magnets.
	One can think of this effect as being similar to the shape anisotropy, but on the scale of separate layers rather than individual atomic magnetic moments.
	This contribution aids the PMA in stabilising the OOP anisotropy, counteracting the \xref{demagnetising field}, but is smaller in magnitude. % Cross MS E: \approx\SI{0.5e-16}{\joule}
	\item \textbf{Inter-magnet magnetostatic interaction} is the only contribution --- besides external input --- that distinguishes between the $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ magnetisation states.
	All aforementioned energy contributions are internal to individual OOP magnets, making the \xref{magnetostatic interaction} the sole reason for the AFM ground state of the OOP ASI. % E_MS: \lesssim\SI{1.1e-17}{\joule}
	\item \textbf{Input}.
	In simulations, an \xref{external magnetic field} is used as a proxy to model SOT.
\end{enumerate}
For a system to be thermally active, the first three of these contributions should mostly cancel out --- to the level where their combined influence is of the same order of magnitude as the inter-magnet magnetostatic interaction, which is usually at least an order of magnitude weaker than the other contributions separately.

\paragraph{Magnet geometry}
% The geometry of nanomagnets in an OOP ASI is shown schematically in~\cref{fig:3:OOP_geometry}.
% TODO: make own figure of nanomagnets?

The magnets considered here are round with a diameter $D_\mathrm{NM}$ and consist of $N_{\ce{Co}}$ layers of \ce{Co} with a thickness $t_{\ce{Co}}$, separated and surrounded by \ce{Pt} layers of thickness $t_{\ce{Pt}}$.
They are placed in an ASI where the lateral spacing between magnets is $S_\mathrm{ASI}$ --- resulting in a lattice parameter $a=D_\mathrm{NM}+S_\mathrm{ASI}$ in a square lattice. \par
These five geometrical parameters have a profound effect on the balance between the aforementioned energy contributions, as summarised in~\cref{tab:3:interactions_geometry}.
The polynomial dependence of some of these relations makes the system quite hard to control: a slight manufacturing difference can yield a vastly different net OOP anisotropy, possibly inhibiting the spontaneous formation of a checkerboard ground state.
Note that the magnetostatic interactions depend on the square of the ferromagnetic volume $V=n_{\ce{Co}} t_{\ce{Co}} D_\mathrm{NM}^2$.

}

These five geometrical parameters are bounded by several physical and practical constraints.
Note that the numerical values of the limits given below are only indicative and may depend on the exact values of the other geometrical parameters.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{FM layer thickness} $\boldsymbol{t_{\ce{Co}}} \lesssim \SI{1.45}{\nano\metre}$. \newline
	This upper bound was experimentally determined~\cite{KUR-24} and is imposed by shape anisotropy.
	As mentioned earlier, the \xref{shape anisotropy} increases linearly with volume, and therefore with $t_{\ce{Co}}$, while the PMA is mostly independent of $t_{\ce{Co}}$. % t_{\ce{Co}} controls the demag compensation of $K_u$.
	For the magnets to remain OOP, the layers must therefore be sufficiently thin. \par
	The closer the thickness is to this upper bound, the lower the effective OOP anisotropy will be.
	Therefore, non-volatile ASI must steer clear of this limit, while thermally active ASI generally try to approach this limit as close as possible.
	As such, this geometrical parameter is often key for balancing the energy landscape.
	\item \textbf{Separation between magnets} $\boldsymbol{S_\mathrm{ASI}} \gtrsim \SI{20}{\nano\metre}$. \newline
	This constraint is of a practical nature, as the minimal size of lateral geometrical features is limited by the accuracy of the lithographic process. \par
	The separation only affects the strength of the magnetostatic interaction between neighbouring magnets, as approximated in \hotspice by \cref{eq:2:E_MS} and the second-order correction of \cref{eq:2:E_MS_order2}.
	In ASI, a strong MS coupling --- hence low $S_\mathrm{ASI}$ --- is often preferred.
	However, for thermally active ASI we will soon see that excessively strong MS coupling is detrimental, resulting in a ``sweet spot'' of MS coupling energies.
	\item \textbf{Number of layers} $\boldsymbol{n_{\ce{Co}}} \lesssim 8$. \newline
	This limit is of a practical nature as well, caused by property drift during deposition of successive layers. \par
	Note that the number of layers does not affect the balance between PMA and shape anisotropy, as the number of interfaces per amount of magnetic material remains constant.
	However, since MS interactions grow $\propto n_{\ce{Co}}^2$, the inter-layer coupling --- and with it the net OOP anisotropy --- becomes increasingly significant for a large number of layers.
	\item \textbf{Diameter} $\boldsymbol{D_\mathrm{NM}} \lesssim \SI{200}{\nano\metre}$. \newline
	Magnets wider than this limit were observed to take on multi-domain states~\cite{KUR-24}, as their demagnetisation energy becomes dominant due to its rapid $\propto D_\mathrm{NM}^4$ growth.
	Even though in-plane magnets without uniform magnetisation have been used for computation~\cite{gartside2022reconfigurable}, we did not intend to use this in the OOP systems.
	Furthermore, the \hotspice simulator requires a single-domain magnetisation state for its Ising-like model to be applicable. \par
	The diameter can be used to control the relative strength between PMA and shape anisotropy and greatly affects the inter-magnet MS coupling.
	\item \textbf{Spacer layer thickness} $\boldsymbol{t_{\ce{Pt}}} \approx \SI{0.8}{\nano\metre}$. \newline
	The spacer thickness must be chosen appropriately to promote FM coupling between layers while maintaining the interfacial anisotropy. % Accounting for various effects such as RKKY coupling
	A thin spacer is beneficial to the net OOP anisotropy due to the $\approx t_{\ce{Pt}}^{-3}$ inter-layer MS coupling dependence.
\end{itemize}

In the particular case of the thermally active OOP ASI fabricated within the \spinengine project, the nanomagnets consist of $n_{\ce{Co}}=7$ ferromagnetic layers of $D_\mathrm{NM}=\SI{170}{\nano\metre}$ diameter and $t_{\ce{Co}} \approx \SI{1.45}{\nano\metre}$ thickness, with $t_{\ce{Pt}} \approx \SI{0.8}{\nano\metre}$ spacing layers in between.
The edge-to-edge spacing between neighbouring magnets is \SI{30}{\nano\metre}, unless specified otherwise, with a saturation magnetisation $M_\mathrm{sat}=\SI{1063}{\kilo\ampere\per\metre}$~\cite{Msat_Co}.

\subsubsection{Logarithmic relaxation}
To better inform our choices for RC in thermally active ASI, it is essential to familiarize ourselves with its relaxation dynamics.
In this section, we numerically investigate this relaxation process with \hotspice by initializing an OOP ASI in a uniform ($\uparrow$) state and subsequently observing its decay towards the checkerboard ground state over a certain timespan.
In the Ising-like model used by \hotspice, two essential system parameters remain, denoted as
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.1em]
	\item[$\boldsymbol{\EEA}$ ---] the energy barrier of a single non-interacting OOP magnet due to the net OOP anisotropy.
	This is the combined contribution of PMA, shape anisotropy and the inter-layer magnetostatic interaction.
	\item[$\boldsymbol{\EMC}$ ---] the magnetostatic coupling energy between nearest neighbours.
	This is responsible for the relaxation to the ground state.
\end{itemize}
Due to the N\'eel-Arrhenius switching law~\eqref{eq:2:Néel}, it is more appropriate to write dimensionless energies ($\EEA/\kBT$ and $\EMC/\kBT$), as it is only this ratio --- not the absolute value of the energies or temperature --- that controls the switching time. \par
In real ASI, imperfections introduced during manufacturing will cause the geometry of separate magnets to differ slightly, which can significantly affect the net OOP anisotropy of various magnets.
In simulations, this will be modelled by a Gaussian spread on the net anisotropy $\EEA$: unless otherwise specified, a standard deviation $\sigma(\EEA) = \SI{5}{\percent}$ will be used.
This provides pinning sites for domain walls, which can make the relaxation process more reproducible.
Such ``consistent variation'' within a particular ASI could ultimately be beneficial to RC by providing a richer output space. \\\par

The relaxation process can be tracked by the average magnetisation $\mavg$ and the local antiferromagnetic order parameter $\qNN = (1 - \langle S_i S_{i+1} \rangle)/2$.
In the uniform state --- where all magnets collectively point $\uparrow$ --- their values will be $\mavg=1$ and $\qNN=0$.
During relaxation, they will transition to the opposite value: $\mavg=0$ and $\qNN=1$.
While a random state has an AFM order $\qNN \approx 0.5$, a state with a value of $\qNN=0.5$ is not necessarily random. \par
\cref{fig:3:OOP_relaxation} shows relaxation profiles for several combinations of $\EEA$ and $\EMC$.
For each combination, the relaxation was run 200 times, with each run performing at most $40N$ switches with the first-switch method, or stopping if the maximum time $t_\mathrm{max}=\SI{1e4}{\second}$ (the right edge of each panel) is reached.
In the figure, each trace consists of 3 areas: the mean, standard deviation and 1st/99th percentile of these 200 runs at any given time. 
This variance is partially due to the randomness of N\'eel-Arrhenius switching, but also because each run used unique randomly sampled $\EEA$ for individual magnets, in accordance with the $\sigma(\EEA) = \SI{5}{\percent}$ variation.

}

A lot of insight into the relaxation process can be gained from~\cref{fig:3:OOP_relaxation}.
Most strikingly, by using a logarithmic scale for the time axis, both $\mavg$ and (to a lesser extent) $\qNN$ trace a very straight line during relaxation.
In other words, the relaxation happens logarithmically --- the first switches occur on a vastly different timescale than the last, with each subsequent switch occurring on average $x$ times later than the previous switch ($t_{i+1} = x t_i \Rightarrow t_n = t_0 x^n$). \par
The cause of this is the magnetostatic interaction\footnote{
	Without the \xref{magnetostatic interaction}, the system would simply be a non-interacting ensemble of nanomagnets, which is known to relax to the ground state exponentially.
	This is the opposite of logarithmic relaxation; the relevant quantities like $\mavg$ would instead show up as straight lines when using a logarithmic y-axis and linear time axis.
}.
Initially, all magnets are in a high-energy state as they all point in the same direction.
After a certain amount of time, a first magnet will switch, thereby slightly stabilising all other magnets in the ASI to some degree.
Whichever magnet randomly switches next will therefore experience a slightly higher effective energy barrier $\EBeff$.
In total, this amounts to a linear increase of $\max(\EBeff)$ --- the effective barrier for the most unstable magnets in the system --- with the amount of magnets that have already switched.
Due to the N\'eel-Arrhenius equation~\eqref{eq:2:Néel}, this translates to an exponentially increasing switching time. \par
This also explains why the slope is less inclined for higher magnetostatic coupling $\EMC$: high coupling means a greater energy change per switch, and therefore a greater exponential increase in the switching time.
Meanwhile, the net OOP anisotropy $\EEA$ also affects the relaxation, but only its timescale: changing $\EEA$ does not affect the aforementioned slope but simply shifts the relaxation curves along the (logarithmic) time axis.
Therefore, accurate control of $\EEA$ on a scale of $\sim 10\kBT$ is required to manufacture an ASI that exhibits a particular relaxation timescale. \par

% The size of the ASI does not significantly affect the relaxation process, apart from reducing the spread on these traces.

\subsubsection{Fitting MFM images}\label{sec:3:OOP:MFM}
% TODO: extend this intro by saying that simple calculations based on the cosines and sines of the four interactions (recall: this was calculated by Alex using Mathematica) does not give a thermally active energy barrier. See the following comment for more details.
% In absence of the neighbors (i.e. no \code{externalddE}, their combined energy barrier is $\approx\SI{-3.6e-18}{\joule}=\SI{-22.5}{\electronvolt}=-871k_BT$ which is far too large to get thermal switching, and on top of that it is negative which means that the magnet would rather sit in-plane which is obviously not observed in reality. Curiously, Alex observes thermal relaxation nonetheless. The energy barrier discrepancy between Mathematica and reality could be due to non-coherent reversal, resulting in a lower energy barrier in reality.
% However, Alex said that the energy barriers calculated with Mathematica in this manner did not seem to be very accurate: in the simulation, they were several tens of \SI{}{\electronvolt} (read: many $k_B T$), while in reality he saw thermal relaxation upon removal of an external saturating stimulus.

\subsection{RC in thermally active OOP square ASI}
\subsubsection{Concept} % Lessons learnt from non-volatile ASI
\paragraph{Input torques: representation in \hotspice}
Contrary to the binary input in the non-volatile OOP ASI, thermally active ASI can be addressed by a continuous range of input.
The input --- in reality applied through spin-orbit torque --- was applied in the simulations in the form of an OOP magnetic field $B_z(t)$ acting on the entire system.
The field was scaled such that its OOP component extends from $B_0$ (minimum) to $B_1$ (maximum), i.e. $B_0 \leq B_z \leq B_1$.

\paragraph{Readout method}
The inverse mean squared error (1/MSE) between o(t) and the desired result (the sawtooth) was used as a performance metric.
